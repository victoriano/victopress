I went for a walk in **Granada**, Spain, with the new iPhone 13 Pro, released last week, and shot all the pictures using the [Apple ProRAW](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211965) format to see how far digital photography is now compared to DSLR cameras. I also used the [VSCO app](https://vsco.co/) for adjusting the color, brightness, and other parameters.

The results were impressive. The computational photography that Apple has developed over the years really shows in low-light situations. The dynamic range captured in the sunset shot above would have been impossible just a few years ago without professional equipment.

## ProRAW vs Standard HEIC

The ProRAW format gives you much more flexibility in post-processing:

- **12-bit color depth** instead of 8-bit
- **More shadow detail** to recover in editing
- **Better highlight handling** in high-contrast scenes
- **No compression artifacts** in gradients

The file sizes are larger (around 25MB per photo), but the quality improvement is worth it if you plan to edit your photos.

## My Favorite Settings

For street photography, I found these settings work best:

1. Use the **1x lens** for most shots
2. Enable **ProRAW** in camera settings
3. Keep **exposure compensation** at -0.3 to preserve highlights
4. Use **gridlines** to help with composition

## Conclusion

The iPhone 13 Pro is a legitimate photography tool. While it won't replace a full-frame mirrorless camera for professional work, it's more than capable for travel photography, street photography, and everyday captures.

The best camera is the one you have with you, and the iPhone is always in your pocket.
