      <h3>What I have done with my life so far?</h3>
      <p>
        From 0 to 17 I grew up in Granada. After graduating from High School I spent a year in NY. Then I decided to move back to Spain and study Computer Science in Madrid. I lived as an exchange student in Melbourne - Australia - and Rome - Italy -, as an undergrad.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have collaborated with media outlets as a freelance and worked with agencies like Getty Images, The Wideangle or Bilderberg.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015 I started Graphext with my old-friend, Miguel, and we moved back the company to Madrid, where I am now based.
