# About Me

I'm a photographer based in **Granada, Spain**, passionate about capturing authentic moments and telling stories through images.

## My Journey

Photography has been my companion for over a decade. What started as a hobby during my travels has evolved into a lifelong pursuit of visual storytelling.

I specialize in:

- **Street Photography** — Capturing candid moments of everyday life
- **Travel Photography** — Documenting cultures and landscapes around the world
- **Portrait Photography** — Revealing the personality behind each face

## Philosophy

> "The best camera is the one you have with you."

I believe in the power of simplicity. Whether I'm shooting with a professional DSLR or my iPhone, the most important thing is being present in the moment and ready to capture it.

## Equipment

My current setup includes:

- Sony A7R IV
- iPhone 15 Pro (always in my pocket)
- Various prime lenses (35mm, 50mm, 85mm)

## Connect

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, have questions about my work, or just want to chat about photography.
