# Language Rules

**All code, comments, and documentation must be written in English.**

This includes:
- Source code and comments
- Variable, function, and class names
- Commit messages
- README and documentation files
- Configuration files
- API documentation
- Error messages and logs

The user may communicate in Spanish, but all code output remains in English.
