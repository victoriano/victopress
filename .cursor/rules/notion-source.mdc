# Architecture Reference

Before implementing new features or making architectural changes, consult the architecture document in Notion:

**📐 ARCHITECTURE.md:** https://www.notion.so/1dd18ac214874a9da121897a495adc1d

This document contains:
- Project objectives and philosophy (files-first)
- Complete file structure and YAML formats
- API endpoints and response formats
- Technical decisions (Remix, Bun, R2, Sharp, etc.)
- Storage and Image adapter interfaces
- Multi-platform deployment configs (Cloudflare, Docker, AWS)
- CMS admin functionalities and components

## How to Use

```
notion-fetch with id: 1dd18ac214874a9da121897a495adc1d
```

Update this document when architectural decisions change.
